          Visual Storyteller & Video Editor

        {/* Description */}
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I'm Soumik, a visual storyteller from West Bengal, India. As a
          passionate freelance video editor with six months of hands-on
          experience, I've had the privilege of working with a variety of
          clients, creating cinematic visuals that tell compelling stories.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          My expertise and interests lie in video editing, filmmaking, short
          films, documentaries, music videos, podcasts, and cinematic travel
          films. I began my journey into film editing after a transformative
          experience in college while pursuing a B.A. in Journalism and Mass
          Communication.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          A short film editing assignment ignited my passion for storytelling
          through visuals, and from that moment, I committed myself to mastering
          the craft. To further develop my skills, I completed formal training
          at the National Institute of Film and Fine Arts in Kolkata, where I
          deepened my technical knowledge and artistic approach.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Although I am relatively new to the freelance market, my enthusiasm
          and determination to grow in this field are unparalleled. I am eager
          to take on new challenges and collaborate with forward-thinking
          clients.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I look forward to working on bigger and bolder projects in the future,
          continually refining my craft and bringing powerful, visually striking
          stories to life.
        </p>
